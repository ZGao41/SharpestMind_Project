# Project Title
Stack OverFlow Smart Answering Bot

## Overview
Modern knowledge workers, such as software developers, data scientists, and machine learning engineers are spending a lot of time searching and reading answers before implementing codes. Stack Overflow is a top must-go-to-website to find some great insights from peers. 

However, as a regular user myself, the default search function from Stack Overflow is hard to use and the information is always scattered. According to a McKinsey report, employees spend 1.8 hours every day searching and gathering information. An interactive and accurate conversational search engine can help developers to save time and effort.

## Background and Motivation
- Developers are spending large amount of time searching for peer coding insights through online forum such as Stack Overflow. However, the current search will not aid them to find the real answers for their questions
- Developers may get lost in the massive information from these forum and waste their time
- An interactive response engine can help to provide a solutions for their requests.
  
## Goals
- Aid developers to quickly and accurately find their answers
- Save the energy and time for developers when searching for information
